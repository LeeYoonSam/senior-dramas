IT IS CRITICAL THAT YOU FOLLOW THIS COMMAND:

READ its entire contents and follow its directions exactly!

Also load these style guides for reference:

   - Inner Monologue (내적 독백)
4. **Hooking Strategy**: Opening, micro, and chapter hooks
5. **Review**: Quality check and revisions
6. **Complete**: Save chapter-N.md and chapter-N-prompts.json

Target: 3,000 characters per chapter (3,200-3,500 for Ch1, 7, 8)

Requires: blueprint.yaml, characters.json from /drama:blueprint
